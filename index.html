            <p id="text"><b>how you would go about selecting  and using IT systems and software</b><br>
                Selecting Software
                In our new ‘wired’ modern reality, software is no less important than products & services in our everyday lives. Whether it’s a personal email program, chat software for instant connection, collaboration software to organize scattered employees, or an ERP implementation to manage company processes – there’s no surviving without them!
                But we’re somewhat more used to buying products & services than software, which is a relatively recent phenomenon. In many ways, selecting software is no different from selecting a product or service. Although intangible, software, also address a very real need, on which personal & professional success often depends. Naturally, some of the same purchase factors apply – brand, service, & maintenance costs.                               
                In spite of the patronizing obviousness of the above, software selection is a grey zone; an underdeveloped arena. This accounts for the high incidence of ‘shelfware‘ – software that are bought with grand intentions, but end up on dusty shelves. This is because unlike products & services, it is not so intuitively evident that software have ‘life cycles’ & need to be ‘maintained’, ‘updated’, & ‘repaired’.                                
                Therefore, purchases are made based on what immediately meets the eye – technical features. This mistake is understandable, because technical features are well documented & advertised, & easy for the buyer to use as decision criteria. But with this approach, factors that are just as pertinent, but not so immediately obvious, get left out. Some research & serious thinking is needed to gauge these ‘hidden’ factors.

        <h3>What is Git and GitHub?</h3>
        <P id="text"><B>Git</B><br>
            Git is a VCS — Version Control System. What that really means is, Git helps us manage our project files. One of the primary things that git does and also the primary reason it exists is to keep track of the entire history of things that you are working on.
            This is especially helpful for software developers because when you are working on a project you first build a basic version of it and then try to improve it by adding new features (or) just experiment with things. This whole process of experimenting with new features is incredibly error prone and you might wanna revert back to your original code.                   This is where Version Control comes into play, it automatically tracks every minute change in your project and allows us to revert back to a previous version no matter how many times you changed your files.
            Another awesome thing that Git allows to do is, it allows people to work together on the same project at the same time without disturbing each other’s files. Collaboration is all the more easier with Git.Team members can work on different features and easily merge changes.
            Git is easy to learn and has a lightning fast performance. It outclasses other Version Control Systems like SubVersion with features like cheap and local branching, convenient staging areas and multiple workflows.
        </P>
        <P id="text"><b>GitHub</b><br>GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. Basically, it is a social networking site for developers. You can look at other people’s code, identify issues with their code and even propose changes. This also helps you in improving your code. On a lighter note, it is a great place to show off your projects and get noticed by potential recruiters.
            In short, Git is Version Control System and GitHub is a hosting service for Git Repositories.

        <p id="text"><b>HTML</b><br>
            HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.
        <br><br><b>CSS</b><br>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.
        <br><br>
        <b>JavaScript</b><br>
            JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.

        <p id="text"><b>What is Trello?</b><br>Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.
            Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like BitBucket or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone, and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello!</p>
        <p id="text"><b>Legal constraints</b><br>
            Legal constraints refer to the many regulations that the activities and practices on a construction project must comply with. These most commonly relate to employment law, safety requirements, planning and building regulations requirements, environmental requirements, and so on.
            Complying with legal requirements can be very time consuming and requires a thorough understanding of complex, often bureaucratic procedures. However, failure to comply can have a considerable negative impact on a project, both in terms of delay, financial penalties, remedial works and even possible criminal proceedings.</p>
        <p id="text"><b>What is the GDPR?</b><br>
             Obviously, technology has radically changed since 1998, leaving data protection legislation in need of a major update. The GDPR seeks to redress oversights and gaps in current laws, offering consumers more control over the ways that organizations collect and use their data while also heightening protection against data breaches. This directive will also streamline data protection laws, requiring that corporations in the EU (as well as their foreign partners) comply with a set of predetermined, standardized regulations.
            The need for this kind of comprehensive data protection legislation has come sharply into focus after a series of high profile data breaches (including LinkedIn and Yahoo). Most recently, Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal forced officials to confront the vulnerability of users’ personal data on social media. GDPR seeks to prevent future instances of “data hijacking” by safeguarding consumers’ data from being collected and distributed without their knowledge or consent. Moreover, by implementing the same laws throughout the EU and abroad, the GDPR aims to establish a clear, universal set of rules. Failure to comply with this legislation will be costly. Companies that fall short of meeting the GDPR regulations will be subject to penalties and fines up to 4% of their annual global turnover. Over time, however, founders of the GDPR anticipate that this legislation will actually save corporations money as they develop better security measures to prevent data breaches and as the global legal environment becomes a simpler place to navigate.

        <p id="text"><b>Users with Disabilities</b><br>
            The range of disabilities which can be impacted by your web site design is tremendous. The most common category cited is blindness or low-vision, but in fact there’s a huge range of potential issues in addition to those.
         <br><b>Blind Users</b><br>
            Blind users require the use of a screen reader to browse the internet. Screen readers function by reading the content of the web page to the user. Rather than merely reading the visual content, screen readers actually process the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) code of the page. Because of this, your usage of appropriate semantic HTML makes all the difference for blind users. Using code right will help blind users to:
            However, some common web design techniques, such as using tables for layout, can cause screen readers to become very confused about the correct order in which to read the page. The design can prove confusing and unusable to a blind user.
            In addition to semantic HTML, a modicum of pure common sense web development can make the difference between an unusable, inaccessible web page and a sensible, easily-navigated site.
        <br><b>Partial or Low Vision</b><br>
            Particularly with the growing population of individuals over 50, issues with fading eyesight are becoming more and more important. Providing high enough contrast and a large enough font for the text to be readable is critical to providing a satisfying web experience for any user with vision problems. The text on a website should be resizable, and frequently it’s a well-considered move to provide alternate views of the site with high contrast or very large text.
        <br><b>Color Blindness</b><br>
             Careless choice of colors or a poor choice of instructions can render your website worthless to a color blind individual. Testing for inappropriate color choice and making certain that color is never the sole distinguishing factor between two items is necessary to provide an accessible site.
        <br><b>Keyboard or Alternate Device Navigation</b><br>
            Users with mobility problems including cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s, quadriplegia or any of a wide variety of other physical disabilities may not be able to use a mouse. Websites should never require a mouse to perform any action. All links on a website should become highlighted clearly not only when the mouse hovers over them, but also if they’ve been selected using the tab key or other pointing device.
        <br><b>Deaf Users</b>
        <br>
            It is a common misperception that the deaf do not suffer problems when visiting web sites. They can see – so they should be able to read your text without any difficulty! In many cases this is true. However, some individuals who were born deaf can have difficult processing written text, and all deaf users will have a great deal of trouble with any audio or video with audio files. For any audio information, a transcription should always be provided. In addition, you should give some thought to providing customer support with the hard of hearing in mind.
        <br><b>Users with Learning Disabilities</b><br>
            Dyslexic users or users with autism may have difficulties processing certain types of information. Users with dyslexica may find text confusing, and be aided by clear graphical symbols associated with appropriate actions. Autistic individuals may have difficulties with idiomatic speech, metaphor, or other non-literal forms of speech.
