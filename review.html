        <h3>What is Git and GitHub?</h3>
        <P id="text"><B>Git</B><br>
            Git is a VCS — Version Control System. What that really means is, Git helps us manage our project files. One of the primary things that git does and also the primary reason it exists is to keep track of the entire history of things that you are working on.
            This is especially helpful for software developers because when you are working on a project you first build a basic version of it and then try to improve it by adding new features (or) just experiment with things. This whole process of experimenting with new features is incredibly error prone and you might wanna revert back to your original code.                   This is where Version Control comes into play, it automatically tracks every minute change in your project and allows us to revert back to a previous version no matter how many times you changed your files.
            Another awesome thing that Git allows to do is, it allows people to work together on the same project at the same time without disturbing each other’s files. Collaboration is all the more easier with Git.Team members can work on different features and easily merge changes.
            Git is easy to learn and has a lightning fast performance. It outclasses other Version Control Systems like SubVersion with features like cheap and local branching, convenient staging areas and multiple workflows.
        </P>
        <P id="text"><b>GitHub</b><br>GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. Basically, it is a social networking site for developers. You can look at other people’s code, identify issues with their code and even propose changes. This also helps you in improving your code. On a lighter note, it is a great place to show off your projects and get noticed by potential recruiters.
            In short, Git is Version Control System and GitHub is a hosting service for Git Repositories.

        <p id="text"><b>HTML</b><br>
            HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.
        <br><br><b>CSS</b><br>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.
        <br><br>
        <b>JavaScript</b><br>
            JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality.

        <p id="text"><b>What is Trello?</b><br>Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.
            Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like BitBucket or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone, and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello!</p>
        <p id="text"><b>Legal constraints</b><br>
            Legal constraints refer to the many regulations that the activities and practices on a construction project must comply with. These most commonly relate to employment law, safety requirements, planning and building regulations requirements, environmental requirements, and so on.
            Complying with legal requirements can be very time consuming and requires a thorough understanding of complex, often bureaucratic procedures. However, failure to comply can have a considerable negative impact on a project, both in terms of delay, financial penalties, remedial works and even possible criminal proceedings.</p>
        <p id="text"><b>What is the GDPR?</b><br>
             Obviously, technology has radically changed since 1998, leaving data protection legislation in need of a major update. The GDPR seeks to redress oversights and gaps in current laws, offering consumers more control over the ways that organizations collect and use their data while also heightening protection against data breaches. This directive will also streamline data protection laws, requiring that corporations in the EU (as well as their foreign partners) comply with a set of predetermined, standardized regulations.
            The need for this kind of comprehensive data protection legislation has come sharply into focus after a series of high profile data breaches (including LinkedIn and Yahoo). Most recently, Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal forced officials to confront the vulnerability of users’ personal data on social media. GDPR seeks to prevent future instances of “data hijacking” by safeguarding consumers’ data from being collected and distributed without their knowledge or consent. Moreover, by implementing the same laws throughout the EU and abroad, the GDPR aims to establish a clear, universal set of rules. Failure to comply with this legislation will be costly. Companies that fall short of meeting the GDPR regulations will be subject to penalties and fines up to 4% of their annual global turnover. Over time, however, founders of the GDPR anticipate that this legislation will actually save corporations money as they develop better security measures to prevent data breaches and as the global legal environment becomes a simpler place to navigate.
