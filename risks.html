                <p id="tbltext">SDigital project managers face many challenges. If you don’t get projects right and make mistakes, they can have significant knock-on effects,
                     which could lead to the projects spiralling out of control. They could take a lot longer, run well over budget, or even fail altogether.
                    Digital project managers are the first port of call for the many different parties involved. Keeping all of them happy, while creating a successful product,
                     is a difficult balancing act. Every project is different, of course, and there are many different aspects to consider but we can analyse and learn 
                     from some common themes. The benefits are enormous: happier teams, better products, happier clients and customers, and ultimately more profit.
                        We’ve talked to some leading project managers around the world to find out what kind of common mistakes they see DPMs make regularly and how to avoid them.</p></td>

                                <li> A few common risks and mitigations for creative digital projects* Not an exhaustive list, but a simple guide
                                        <li> Ineffective or low impact change management Organisation resistant to change including key delivery departments – significant new processes and structures in place that may cause short term resistance Mitigation: Educate, Inform and communicate; above all else, listen
                                    </li>
                                <li>  Too many committee decisions Artistic direction becomes muddied due to too many stakeholders Mitigation: In the end something that is creative needs creative direction. Identify who does that straight from the go and define their influence and make it clear to everyone, that they are the final arbiter.
                                    </li>
                                <li> Differing departmental requirements Will delay launch and cause unsatisfied internal customers; following changes will cost more money. Mitigation: try to understand what they actually need not what they say they need.
                                    </li>
                                <li> Project resources may be reallocated for other (higher) priority projects Resources are currently committed to this project. Losing a resource would severely delay project. Mitigation: Plan ahead and understand the rhythm of the business, where key events happen
                                    </li>
                                <li> Departmental Capacity Too much to do, day-to-day tasks getting the way; not enough people or time and this project getting the way of BAU Mitigation: Understand workflows and demands, identify potential bottlenecks
                                    </li>
                                <li>   Inputs from departments will not be available when required Internal processes and workflows aren’t up to producing content on time. Mitigation: Identify potential bottlenecks in workflows, communicate what you want and by when
                                    </li>
                                <li>  Recruitment and Resources Can you find the right people in time to do the job? Do you have budget to go further to find them? Mitigation: Identify early and start recruiting early, use your networks
                                    </li>
                                <li>   Data Issues Data migration may result in loss of customer data. Customer data is key for day to day business operations. Mitigation: Whatever you make, data has to be at the heart from step 1.
                                    </li>
                                <li>   Internal Customers find new workflows and processes problematic Badly affects workflows Mitigation: Early training; tell the story of why you have to change and how that will feel
                                    </li>
                                <li>   Audiences may be resistant to new product Customer feedback to be instrumental in design, but not all customers will like the changes. May result in bad publicity or customer satisfaction issues. Mitigation: Test at every stage, even if its small groups of customers
                                </li>
                                <li>   Impact on Sales Your new product causes drop in sales Mitigation: Be prepared to monitor from day one and then iterate quickly. Launch is not a stop it’s a start
                                    </li>
                                <li>  Sign off delays Missed deadlines Mitigation: Define sign off dates clearly in plan up front and communicate it. If they still don’t do it, nag, sit outside doors and demand sign off and name and shame.</li>

        <p id="text"><b>5 Reasons Digital Projects Fail: The Forgotten Role of Business Process</b><br>
            <br><b>1.Misalignment with business processes:</b><br> Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.

            <br><b>2.Lack of cross-functional expertise:</b><br> Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.
            
            <br><b>3.Limited digital strategy.</b><br> Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.
            
            <br><b>4.Fixed plans that don’t account for change:</b><br> The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment. 
            
            <br><b>5.Overambition:</b><br> Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. Saying "Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure.</p>
